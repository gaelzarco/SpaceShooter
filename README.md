HUGE THANKS TO JARED MILLS FOR SHARING HIS SPACE SHOOTER WHICH SERVED AS THE BONES FOR THIS PROJECT.

Controls are simple. Move around with the arrow keys and fire your laser using the spacebar. Do your best to get the highest score possible. Don't let enemy targets hit you or it is GAME OVER!

This game was developed using nothing but good ol' vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

At the game's current state, the laser can bug out and destroy enemies unintentionally. A solution has not yet been discovered and it can be annoying but it is what it is.
