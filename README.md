# UNLV FSD Milestone Project

Controls are simple. Move around with the arrow keys and fire your laser using the spacebar. Do your best to get the highest score possible. Don't let the enemies through or it is GAME OVER!

This game was developed using nothing but vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

At the game's current state, the laser can bug out and destroy enemies unintentionally. A solution has not yet been discovered and it can be annoying but it is what it is. I have also not been able to get enemy hit detection with the player working either. Coins are something I want to add but I ran out of time. Besides all of this, the game is playable, keeps score, has a start menu and an end state. Have fun.

I DO NOT OWN ANY ASSETS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF THIS GAME. MOST IF NOT ALL WERE AQUIRED ON OPENGAMEART.ORG. THIS GAME WILL NOT BE COMMERCIALIZED.

Thanks to Jared Mills for the bones of this project
